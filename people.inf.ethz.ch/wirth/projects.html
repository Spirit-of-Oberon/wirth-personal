Summary of projects by N. Wirth, 1962 - 1999</H1>

<H3>
Euler, 1962-1965</H3>
Efforts to identify and combine the essential and fundamental concepts
of programming languages, in particualr of ALGOL 60, led to Wirth's dissertation
under the guidance of Prof. H. D. Huskey at the University of California
at Berkeley, and to the definition of the language Euler. The language
was implemented on the IBM 704 computer. After publication the project
was continued at Stanford University and resulted in an improved implementation
on the Burroughs B5000 computer. This work led the foundation for the method
of the microprogrammed, stack-oriented interpreter, first tested on an
IBM 360/30 computer. This method became widespread much later and was to
play a key role in the implementation of high-level languages on microcomputers.
Another important aspect of this research was the development of efficient,
general parsing methods, and the systematic coupling of semantic interpretation
with syntactic analysis. The so-called precedence grammars originated in
the context of this project.
<H3>
ALGOL-W, 1964-1967</H3>
The work on Euler attracted the interest of the IFIP Working Group 2.1.
This group had the task of promulgating and further enhancing ALGOL 60.
Three proposals for a successor language were submitted in 1965. In the
decisive meeting at Warsaw in the fall of 1966, the proposal of A. van
Wijngaarden was elected to be further pursued. In 1970, it eventually became
ratified by IFIP as ALGOL 68. Whereas it represented a radically new language,
Wirth's proposal had been less ambitious and based on the idea to extend
ALGOL 60. A compiler was implemented for his (subsequently modified) proposal,
and it later became used (under the name Algol W) at many universities
operating IBM 360 computers. It contributed significantly to uphold the
ideas of ALGOL 60.

<P>Since Algol-W was implemented on one of the first IBM 360 computers,
and because only an assembler and a Fortran compiler were available, which
both were deemed as unsuitable, Wirth conveived a so-called system implementation
language. It was supposed to facilitate and speed up the Algol effort,
and at the same time it was to be simple enough to avoid a large effort
for its own implementation. These goals were fully achieved, and the resulting
language PL360 unexpectedly became used at many other installations too.
It was the prototype for other, similar developments for other computer
architectures.
<H3>
Pascal, 1968-1972</H3>
Freed from the constraining influence of a working group's consensus, Wirth
developped the language Pascal in Zurich. The basis was Algol-W and the
desire to have a language that would satisfy the requirements of system
design (compilers, operating systems, etc.). Also, there was to be a basis
of clear concepts and structures, definable axiomatically and independently
of any particular computer, as the language was to be suitable also for
teaching in an academic environment. Pascal has satisfied these requirements;
it is today one of the most widely used languages in computer science education.
The first Pascal compiler was designed in Zurich for the CDC 6000 computer
family, and it became operational in 1970. Already in 1972 Pascal was used
in introductory programming courses.
<H3>
Venus, 1970-71</H3>
In 1970, the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) acquired a large-scale
computer system. In its selection, priority was given to the efficient
processing of numerical problems (number crunching). Whereas the concept
of time-sharing spread everywhere else, the chosen CDC Cyber system's software
was ill-suited for this mode of operation. Under the direction of Wirth
and with the cooperation of the ETH Computation Center, the time sharing
system Venus emerged in 1970. It met the stringent requirement of not infringing
on the effectiveness of the batch processed number crunching tasks. Wirth
programmed the Venus text editor; the system, although by now obsolescent,
is still in daily use at ETH. It made it possible to introduce the concept
of time-sharing to ETH, without which a modern computation center would
be unthinkable.
<H3>
Pascal-P, 1972-74</H3>
It had always been a major goal in the development of Pascal to demonstrate
that structured languages need not be inferior to the predominant Fortran,
if sufficient attention and care was paid to their implementation. But
it soon became clear that industry had no interest in undertaking this
demonstrations, although such engineering projects typically should fall
into industry's domain. A second Pascal compiler effort was therefore launched
at ETH. The new compiler produced code that was as good as that generated
by commercially developped Fortran compilers. Furthermore, this project
served as a test for the method of stepwise program refinement propagated
by Wirth. A fringe benefit was the welcome capability to satisfy requests
to help implement Pascal on other computers, as these requests from other
universities became more frequent. The solution lay in replacing the new
compiler's code generator by one producing code for a hypothetical architecture
that was easily implemented on other machines in the form of a hand-coded
interpreter. This architecture, stack-based, became known as the P-machine,
its instruction set as P-code. (P for portable). It bacame the basis of
the large majority of Pascal implementations which first appeared on large-scale
computers (IBM, Univac, DEC, Siemens). But the genuine break-through occurred
after microprocessors became widely available and it became clear that
Pascal-P implementation was feasible for them (UCSD- Pascal).
<H3>
Modula, 1973-76</H3>
Programming languages are mathematical theorems. They represent a methodology
of programming, of abstract machine construction. In 1973, Wirth started
a project to investigate the basic concepts of designing systems with concurrent
processes, i.e. of multi- programming. The emerging design rules (guidelines)
inevitably led to the formulation of language constructs expressing the
generation and synchronization of concurrent activities. Their embedding
in an environment of a minimal support language led to Modula. Implementation
was conducted on a PDP-11 computer. A first successful application was
the system Hexapus that allowed to connect minicomputers in laboratories
with the Computation Center and is still in popular use today.
<H3>
Lilith, 1977-1981</H3>
During a sabbatical year spent at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center,
Wirth was confrontred with an entirely new concept in computer usage: the
personal work station. Without the least doubt, the personal work station
was superior to the conventional computation center almost wherever computers
were used: for the computer scientist, the system designer, in the office,
the laboratory, and in particular also in the class room. Unquestionably,
the advances in microelectronics would make it possible to manufacture
personal work stations economically within the next five years. Whoever
had a work station at his disposal would be ahead in the development of
software suitable to this new mode of operation. In 1977, Wirth initiated
a research project to develop a powerful work station: Lilith. A primary
objective was to combine the design of hardware and software. Thereby the
project expanded into an integrated design effort for hardware, microcode,
operating system, compiler, and elementary application programs. The new
mode of highly interactive usage required new concepts concerning the operating
system and editors.

<P>Inspite of the enormous task, the goal was successfully reached within
three years thanks to the intensive and dedicated work of up to seven assistants.
Today, 60 Lilith computers are in daily use at the Institute at ETH, and
about 250 more in universities and in industry (e.g. Burroughs, Floating-Point
Systems, TRW, Tektronix, Signetics) in the USA. Lilith demonstrated that
a workstation can be a powerful, convenient, and even economical tool not
only in the office, but in applications which so far had been the exclusive
domain of large scale computers, such as computer-aided design.

<P>Apart from the operating system and the compiler, interactive editors
belong to the basic software of a system intended for program development.
Editors were to be designed in entirely new ways; after all, the challenge
lay in making optimal use of the new facilities offered by the hardware,
the high-resolution, bit-mapped screen, and the mouse as a position input
device. Both the prototype text editor Dina and the editor Sil for line
drawings were programmed by Wirth himself. Dina was the ancestor of the
later document preparation systems Andra and Lara which allow arbitrary
text layout and the use of many fonts, and Sil is heavily used to draw
all kinds of diagrams, in particular circuit diagrams.

<P>Perhaps the most significant contribution of the Lilith project was
that it made it possible to conceive solutions that would not have been
thinkable with commercially available products. The first 10 Liliths were
installed in 1980, five years before similar systems were marketed.
<H3>
Modula-2, 1977-1980</H3>
Among other things, it was the conscious restriction to use a single programming
language only that made the completion of the Lilith project possible in
such a short time. Wirth decided to design a revision of Pascal, sacrificing
upward compatibility in return for the advantage of avoiding Pascal's deficiencies:
Modula-2. The principal new concepts were:
<UL>
<LI>
The module as a unit of program which can be compiled separately.</LI>

<LI>
The coroutine as the basic buiding block for systems involving concurrent
processes.</LI>

<LI>
An encapsulated set of types and procedures which allow access to machine-specific
objects.</LI>
</UL>
The first Modula-2 compiler was completed at ETH in 1979. It was implemented
on a PDP-11 computer and then ported onto Lilith. The interest in Modula-2
soon grew, because it offered considerable advantages over Pascal, particularly
in the construction of large systems developped by teams. The compiler
was distributed to several hundred universities and places in industry,
and soon there were companies offering their own developments (Logitech,
Volition Systems, Tartan Laboratories). The advantages of Modula-2 were
above all paying off in the development of the Lilith software itself.
The compiler, the entire operating system, the editors, and all utilities
were programmed exclusively in Modula-2. This demonstrated that the confinement
to a single language is not only possible but even advantageous.
<H3>
Computer-Network, 1980-82</H3>
The personal workstation gains enormously in value, if it is connected
with other stations via a network. Impersonal stations, so-called servers,
are of great importance, such as printers and central file stores. Under
the direction of Wirth, a network interface was developped for Lilith,
based on the principle of Ethernet. This 3 Mbit/s computer network was
the first of its kind in Switzerland.
<H3>
Laser Printer, 1982</H3>
Although Wirth had experienced the impressive versatility and the undisputable
advantages of laser printers at Xerox in 1976, he had to wait until 1982
to obtain such a device at an affordable price. He acquired the first laser
printer of this kind in Europe (Canon LBP-10), designed the hardware and
software interface for Lilith, and thereby showed that Lilith was an ideal
real-time computer to drive a laser printer's video signal, powerful enough
to generate the 6 million raster dots of a printed page while the page
is moving past the printer's drum. Under pressure to publish a book on
Modula-2, he also programmed the document formatter system Skylla/Zeus,
with which it was possible to produce the camera-ready original of the
book.
<H3>
Modula-2 Compiler, 1983-85</H3>
Over the years it became evident that the available Modula-2 compilers,
including the one from ETH, were less than optimal, and through mediocre
performance sometimes deterred users to take full advantage of Modula-2.
Wirth decided to develop a new compiler from scratch by himself. It is
based on the simple principle of one-pass compilation, whose application
had become possible because of the large memories of modern computers,
and which eliminates most of the slow accesses to secondary storage devices.
The new compiler is remarkable because of its clear structure, its compactness
and its efficiency. The program is about 5000 lines long, compared to 10'000
of its predecessor and 100'000 of comparable Ada compilers, and it compiles
itself in less than 2 minutes, compared with half an hour required by its
predecessor. These advantages are not only visible in the compiler's use,
but they demonstrate that powerful modern languages do not necessarily
require giant, complex translators, as is so often claimed.
<H3>
Ceres 1 - 3, 1984-1990</H3>
Five years after Lilith, a second project was started to develop a new
workstation. Not the design of a new processor architecture stood in the
foreground, but rather the acquisition of know-how in the structure and
use of modern hardware technology, also in conjunction with software development.
Hence, the computer was to be based on a commercially available microprocessor.
The choice fell to the NS32000 family of National Semiconductor (then still
called the 16000). After the completion of a prototype with the 32016 processor,
both Wirth and codesigner H. Eberle felt that a new design should be based
on a 32-bit scheme. The second prototype was therefore built around the
NS32032 part, the first genuine 32-bit processor on the market. The memory
consisted of 64 256K-DRAM and 32 novel, dual-port 64K-VRAM chips, the latter
implementing the frame buffer for the 1024x800 bit-mapped display with
minimal bus interference.

<P>In early 1986 33 Ceres-1 computers were built by Hardmeier &amp; Co.
in Winterthur, and subsequently tested in our Institute, proving that our
goals for robustness and cost effectiveness were well reached. They were
immediately put into daily use for research and teaching. A second series
was built in the following year.

<P>Progress in semiconductor technology had accelerated to a degree that
after only a few years much more powerful machines could be built, even
with reduced cost. In 1987-88, Ceres-2 was developed, mostly by B. Heeb
under Wirth's supervision. It was based on the NS32532 processor, delivering
a sevenfold increase in power over Ceres-1. The use of 1M-bit DRAMs facilitated
the enlargement of memeory to 4 or 8 MBytes. 20 Ceres-2 machines were built
by the same company in 1988.

<P>The third model, Ceres-3, was designed in 1989 with the purpose of providing
a low-cost workstation for student laboratories. The ratio of power vs.
cost was of foremost concern. The station, built around the NS32GX32 processor,
also had to operate without any moving parts in order to minimize maintenance
cost and noise. No fan was to be used for cooling. The goals were met,
and in 1990 100 Ceres-3 were built, all of them by a single engineer in
four months. Since then, the machines are in use in offices and mostly
student laboratories, connected by a network and served by a Ceres-1 server
machine.
<H3>
Oberon Language and System, 1986-1990</H3>
A sabbatical year at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (1984-85) brought
Wirth into closer touch with the Cedar Operating System, developed in the
preceding years at PARC. This was perhaps the first system truly tuned
to the needs of personal workstations, and freed from the framework inherited
from central computers with a batch processing mode. In daily use, however,
Cedar showed all too clearly the symptoms of large software developed by
large groups of people: it was bulky and unreliable. It had already become
so complex, and its structure had become so intertwined that it was most
difficult, if not impossible, to understand it. Wirth decided to undertake
the development of a new system, based on concepts suggested by Cedar,
but with the firm goal to keep its size such that it could be well understood
as a whole, and could be explained in detail in the literature and in courses.
Together with J. Gutknecht he worked on the conception and the detailed
programming for the following 3-4 years, after which the basic, but easily
extensible system was operational.

<P>Although it was planned to use Modula-2 to implement the Oberon System,
it soon became evident that a fundamental facility needed for extensibility
was lacking: type extension. It was decided to also discard various facilities
of lesser importance of Modula-2, and to construct a new, derived language
and its compiler. Being an integral part of the project, the language also
obtained the name Oberon.

<P>Language and System soon became the standard tools in the Institute
for software development, and in particular the development of system extensions.
Wirth himself developed and programmed a graphics editor and software for
the network connecting the Ceres workstations. A particular challenge was
the design of a server station for printing, file distribution, and electronic
mail, all together under the constraint of Oberon's single process property.
Using a simple, clear concept proved to be a large benefit; the server
operates without failure continuously for years.
<H3>
Hardware Design with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), 1990-1999</H3>
Similarity and difference between hardware and software design always had
intreagued Wirth as a topic. With the emergence of programmable logic devices,
the gap between the two fields narrowed. A project to familiarize a team
with the new possibilities was established, and research in design methods
using the new devices was started. It led to a set of design tools, including
a specification language (Debora, B. Heeb), its compiler with several "back
ends" for printed circuits boards, PLDs, and FPGAs. The usefulness of these
tools was demonstrated by applying them in the construction of a workstation
(Chamaeleon, also Ceres-3). The construction process starting from a textual
specification and ending with a board layout and PLD programs was automated,
and it required almost no manual intervention.

<P>Wirth realized early, that FPGAs would be particularly useful as a field
for experimentation in learning digital circuit design, replacing expensive,
pluggable circuit modules by programmable cells. He equipped 25 Ceres-3
workstations in a student laboratory with an FPGA and uses them intensively
in a digital design class. Along with a new project in tool design went
the formulation of his language Lola, specifically tailored to the need
of teaching in a systematic manner, dispensing with the myriads of side-issues
inherent in commercial HDLs. The tool set consists of a compiler converting
the program (circuit) text into an abstract data structure suitable for
further processing, an editor for constructing circuits implemented by
the FPGA, i.e. for generating a layout, and a checker comparing the specification
in Lola with the layout.
<H3>
Automatic Control of Model Helicopter</H3>
In 1995 Wirth joined a project undertaken at the Institute of Automatic
Control and Measurement. The goal was the development of a system to allow
a model helicopter to fly autonomously a preprogrammed path. Wirth designed
an on-board computer system with a Strong-ARM processor at its core. Aside
from the hardware, he also programmed various software tools, including
an Oberon subset compiler with additional features for real-time programming.
The computer board was built by I. Noack.

<P>The resulting computer system, called Olga, made use of experience with
programmable gate arrays, and used the novel Xilinx-Algotronix 6200 fine-grained
FPGA for the generation and sensing of pulse-width modulated signals to
control the servos. Furthermore, the computer was connected to a compass,
a global positioning system (GPS), and a data link via several standard
RS-232 interfaces. This system resulted in a drastic reduction of weight
and power consumption, and an increase in computing performance compared
to the one used before, inspite of the fact that floating-point arithmetic
was to be programmed based on integer arithmetic.

<P>The helicopter carrying Olga weighs about 15 kg and is powered by a
35ccm engine. Wirth pushed for a second project based on a downsized helicopter
model with a weight of less than 5 kg and a conventional 10ccm engine.
This was realized with a considerably smaller computer board, but the same
Strong-ARM core and software base. The large FPGA was replaced by several
small PLDs. This project, Horla, was confined to the more modest goal of
using the computer only to stabilize the inherently unstable craft, while
position, speed and direction would remain under remote control by the
pilot.

<P>Both projects collected in a remarkable way the various techniques and
tools on which Wirth had worked during the past decade: Compiler, operating
system, programmable devices (FPGA, PLD) and their design tools including
the language Lola, and circuit design in general. Both projects were successful,
although only after several years of effort - and patience.
<H3>
Teaching</H3>
Wirth became professor at ETH in 1968. In 1970, he and his colleague C.A.
Zehnder presented a proposal for the introduction of a curriculum in computer
science. A second attempt to establish the subject as an academic discipline
failed again in 1974. A new Department was finally established in 1981,
and Wirth became its head from 1982 to 1984, and again 1988-1990.

<P>Meanwhile, the computer science courses continued to be directed primarily
towards the students of mathematics and electrical engineering. Wirth had
a strong influence on the contents of the introductory courses and gave
form to many of the advanced courses. Several times his lecture material
condensed into books which became translated into many languages: Systematic
Programming (1972), Algorithms and Data Structures (1975), Compiler Construction
(1976). Also his books Pascal - User Manual and Report (1974), Programming
in Modula-2 (1982), Programming in Oberon (1992), and Project Oberon (1993)
are widely read.
